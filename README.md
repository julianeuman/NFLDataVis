# NFLDataVis


## About

This is a project for CS 4460: Information Visualization
This project provides an interacitive data vis tool that can be used to identify trends and stats from the 2015-2016 NFL system.

To view a video that further explains the purpose of our project and gives a demo of the system please go to the following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH1qWdHN-Pc&feature=youtu.be

## Motivation
There is large quantities of data available for NFL statistics, but very few comprehensive visualizations of this data. Our goal was to encorporate as much data from all the NFL teams and provides an interactive visualization that lets the user decide what it is they want to compare and find in the data.

## Installation
To view and interact with the project:
 - download the repository
 - in a terminal navigate to the directory where the src files exist
 - Set up an http server - ex: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Once the project is up an running, you now have the freedom to select what team or division is relevant to what you are looking for, and then select the stats or ranges of your choosing.
